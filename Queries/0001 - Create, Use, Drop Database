CREATE DATABASE school;                -- for creating school DB. Here school is DB name

CREATE DATABASE school;                -- school DB is already created if i execute it again it will give me error

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS school;  -- It'll not give error but give warning that it is already created. 

DROP DATABASE school;                  -- It'll delete DB

DROP DATABASE Student;                 -- It'll give error Bcoz it is not exists in the Schema to avoid this type of error, we include IF EXISTS clouse so it'll check that delete the DB if exists or if not exists it'll give warning.

CREATE DATABASE College;
USE College;                           -- To tell the server that I'm using this DB for any manipulation.

SHOW DATABASES;                        -- To see all the DB present in the server.
